## eagler-server-velocity

this is a template velocity server with eaglercraft support. It also has nlogin, limbo, anticheat, ect, so its a good base if you're trying to self host a network. you can replace dionysus with whatever version you want, i just chose dionysus because it has really good performance for 1.12.2 anarchy servers which a good amount of people are trying to run for school servers.

### Customizing

i added anticheat, so if you want hacking, remove ``velocity/plugins/OriginBlacklist.jar``, and``paper/plugins/grimac-bukkit-2.3.72.jar``. also enabled paper's antixray, so disable that if you want aswell ``paper/paper.yml``

you can change the text for the login text at ``velocity/nlogin/lang/messages_en.yml``

if you wanna change the pause menu links and logos and whatnot, do that in ``/velocity/plugins/eaglerxserver/pause_info.yml``

if you wanna change the web page from the walter white one, do it at ``velocity/eaglerweb/web`` or you can remove the eaglerweb plugin entirely. 

### Forwarding

If you're trying to self host but have no idea what you're doing, i recommend installing tailscale on the device youre selfhosting with, then running funnel on it so it can access the internet without having to port forward. https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel
